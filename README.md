# LÖVE Game Scripting System (LGSS)

This tool is a copycat of the **Ruby Game System Script** (**RGSS**) but made in `LUA`  for the framework **LÖVE**.

[page of the LÖVE framework](https://love2d.org/)

Its main purpose is to run a game created with RPG Maker XP in LÖVE.

Its second purpose is to provide a great tool to easily create a game !

*The ultimate goal of the project is an RPG Maker-like, simple game creation software.*

| _This project is at its early stage_
